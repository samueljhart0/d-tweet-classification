# Disaster Tweet Classification
This a public repository for a project classifying disaster tweets using a Convolutional Neural Network paired with pre-trained word embeddings for comparison against a Naive Bayes Classfier and a BERT Transformer for Sequence Classification. It was used as a final research project in a course in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
